# Epistemic Tier Classification Skill

When invoked, classify the concept or proposal using the T0–T5 taxonomy.

T0 — Mechanically proven or deterministic. Examples: RFC 8785 test vector conformance, SHA-256 collision resistance, pure reducer determinism.
T1 — Empirically validated. Examples: VCG calibration measurement, Bernstein bound coverage.
T2 — Engineering hypothesis with defined measurement criteria. Examples: E1 ambiguity routing thresholds, K-bound defaults.
T3 — Research conjecture with a falsifiable prediction. Examples: quasicrystal-CDT spectral correspondence.
T4 — Speculative systems vision with no current implementation path. Examples: swarm planetary coordination, AEGIS civilisational substrate.
T5 — Creative or worldbuilding exploration. Examples: Cycle series documents.

Domain tier ceilings enforce where each tier of content may appear:
- src/core, src/event, src/gate: T0 only
- src/verifier, src/calibration: T0–T1
- src/projection, src/pipeline: T0–T2
- docs/research: T3
- docs/vision: T4
- docs/cycles: T5

Migration rule: no T4 or T5 construct may ground a T0–T2 claim without an explicit evidence review showing the construct has been promoted through the tier hierarchy.

If a T4 or T5 concept appears in implementation code, flag it as:
TIER VIOLATION: [concept] at [file:line] is classified as T[N] but appears in a T[M] context. This requires evidence review before it can be used here.
