# Specification Compliance Skill

When invoked, check the proposed or completed implementation against the frozen specification.

The canonical specification is docs/SOVEREIGN_OMEGA_INTEGRATED_SPEC_v2.md.
The implementation brief is docs/SOVEREIGN_OMEGA_IMPL_BRIEF_Qwen.md.

For each module being written or modified, verify the following:

The module's guarantee boundary matches what the spec states. If the spec says a property
holds only under explicit assumptions, the implementation must document those same
assumptions. The implementation must not claim stronger guarantees than the spec.

The module uses the correct statistical method. E4 uses empirical Bernstein bounds,
not Hoeffding. If Hoeffding appears anywhere in gate logic, flag it as a spec violation.

Version mismatches abort rather than fall back. Any RuntimeVersionPin validation
path that silently uses a default version is a spec violation.

The trust partitioning is correct. V4 and V5 verifiers must never contribute to VCG
calibration or gate decisions. If advisory verifier output reaches the calibration loop,
flag it as a spec violation.

Report compliance as:
SPEC COMPLIANCE: [module] — COMPLIANT / NON-COMPLIANT
Non-compliant items: [list each violation with spec section reference]
