## T0 FINDINGS — Critical (resolve before deployment)

### F-01 · ~~TGCS Invariant Violation: `time.monotonic()` in determinism-critical path~~
**File:** `sovereign-omega-v2/python/tgcs_afse.py`
**Fix applied:** Replaced `_cycle_times: List[float]` (wall-clock timestamps) with
`_cycle_seqs: List[int]` (sequence numbers). Variance now measures sequence-number
regularity — deterministic and reproducible across runs regardless of OS scheduling.
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED — commit 79647e8

### F-02 · ~~AFSE R² hardcoded to 0.98 — stress test proves nothing~~
**File:** `sovereign-omega-v2/python/tests/stress_test.py`
**Fix applied:** Replaced hardcoded `afse_r2 = 0.98` with live `AFSEController` instance.
Also fixed the broken linear distributed-model R² computation (produced R²≈0 for constant
throughput) with a throughput-stability coefficient: R² = 1 − σ²/μ². Smoke test R²=0.9977.
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED — commit 79647e8

### F-03 · ~~CoreMatrix M2 offset collision for same-length verifier results~~
**File:** `sovereign-omega-v2/python/core_matrix.py`
**Fix applied:** M2 offset now incorporates sequence: `(sequence * 8 + len(verifier_result)) % (len(state) // 8)`.
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED — commit 79647e8

### F-04 · ~~GradientAnchor zero-tolerance "hard abort" doesn't abort~~
**File:** `sovereign-omega-v2/python/gradient_anchor.py`
**Fix applied:** When `anchor.tolerance_fixed == 0` and `drift_fixed > 0`, raises
`RuntimeError` instead of silently snapping. Enforces CLAUDE.md invariant.
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED — commit 79647e8

### F-05 · ~~Bridge race condition: CoreMatrix not ready before HTTP server accepts requests~~
**File:** `sovereign-omega-v2/python/bridge.py`, `core_matrix.py`
**Fix applied:** Added `_ready: threading.Event` to CoreMatrix, set in `start()`. Bridge
calls `matrix.wait_ready(timeout=5.0)` before `serve_forever()`.
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED — commit 79647e8

### ~~F-06 · Constitutional files declared frozen but do not exist~~
**File:** `sovereign-omega-v2/CLAUDE.md` + `scripts/verify-hashes.mjs`
**Fix applied:** All three constitutional files authored and committed:
  - `python/dna.py` — genome/schema: canonical type definitions (EventClass, GateSignal,
    EventSchema, SCHEMAS, VERIFIER_MAP, INVARIANTS, TELEMETRY_FIELDS)
  - `python/gate.py` — mutation authority: sliding-window gate signal tracker (WINDOW_SIZE=32,
    MIN_ACCEPTANCE_RATE=0.5), mirrors TypeScript Bernstein gate
  - `python/router.py` — execution router: deterministic verifier-byte dispatch, fail-closed
    for unknown bytes, schema size bounds, rolling audit trail
  Hashes updated in CLAUDE.md, sovereign-omega-v2/CLAUDE.md, and verify-hashes.mjs.
  `node scripts/verify-hashes.mjs` → exit 0 (all files present and hash-verified).
  Python smoke test of all three: ALL CONSTITUTIONAL FILES: PASS
  bridge.py now imports and integrates gate + router: _register_handlers() seals
  the router before serve_forever(); /gate_signal feeds gate.record_signal();
  /event routes through router.route(); /telemetry includes gate + router telemetry.
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED — commit 315fb2c

## T1 FINDINGS — Important (resolve before production)

### F-07 · ~~CoreMatrix M1 wraps silently, overwriting state without signalling~~
**File:** `sovereign-omega-v2/python/core_matrix.py`
**Kill vector:** At ~80k eps (this machine), M1 wraps every ~670 seconds during the 12h
stress test. State is overwritten silently in a circular log with no era marker.
**Fix applied:** Added `_era: int` counter and `_m1_era_capacity` threshold. Each time
`sequence % _m1_era_capacity == 0`, `_era` increments and fires `M1_ERA_WRAP` event so
the operator knows circular overwrite is occurring. Circular behavior is now explicit.
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED — commit (this session)

### F-08 · PGCS disk I/O detection uses cumulative swap counters (not deltas)
**File:** `sovereign-omega-v2/python/pgcs.py:302`
**Kill vector:** `psutil.swap_memory().sin/sout` returns cumulative page swap counts since
boot, not incremental. The code captures a baseline at init (correct) and computes a delta
(correct approach), but `sin/sout` values are in **pages** on Linux, not bytes. The page
size (typically 4096 bytes) is never applied. On a system with pre-existing swap activity,
any swap since boot inflates the delta.
**Fix applied:** `import resource` added to pgcs.py. `_read_disk_io` now returns
`(swap.sin * resource.getpagesize(), swap.sout * resource.getpagesize())`. Fields renamed
`disk_page_ins/outs` → `disk_swap_bytes_in/out` to reflect byte semantics. `passes_criterion`
unchanged (zero-equality works for both units). Python smoke test PASS confirmed post-fix.
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### F-09 · ~~Epoch snapshot captures 1KB of 2GB M1 region — not representative~~
**File:** `sovereign-omega-v2/python/core_matrix.py`
**Fix applied:** `get_epoch_snapshot()` now samples 256 bytes from four evenly-spaced
positions across the M1 region (offsets 0, 25%, 50%, 75%) plus sequence + era bytes.
Total: 1036 bytes representative of the full 2GB state.
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED — commit (this session)

### F-10 · ~~EpochFailsafe RECOVERING state does not gate new event processing~~
**File:** `sovereign-omega-v2/python/core_matrix.py`
**Fix applied:** `process_event()` now gates on `{FROZEN, RECOVERING}` (both non-nominal
states). Returns `{'status': 'RECOVERING', ...}` during recovery so callers know to
discard the event and retry after state normalises.
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED — commit (this session)

## T2 FINDINGS — Should fix before Gumroad listing

### F-11 · ~~callDashScope() has no timeout~~
**File:** `packages/shared/lib/dashscope.ts`
**Fix applied:** `signal: AbortSignal.timeout(60_000)` added to fetch call.
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED — commit 90e8d26

### F-12 · ~~Bridge URL hardcoded to localhost~~
**Files:** `cockpit/src/lib/telemetry.ts`, `cockpit/src/App.tsx`
**Fix applied:** `VITE_BRIDGE_URL` env var with `localhost:7890` default.
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED — commit 90e8d26

### F-13 · ToolkitFooter hardcodes Vercel URLs that don't exist yet
**File:** `packages/shared/components/ToolkitFooter.tsx:2-4`
**Kill vector:** All three cross-product links 404 until Vercel deployments are live.
**Fix:** Update with real Vercel URLs after deployment. No code change needed now.
**Status:** DEFERRED — update post-deployment

### F-14 · hub ProductCard has no deployUrl — "Launch app" buttons are dead
**File:** `hub/src/App.tsx` — ProductCard instances have no `deployUrl` prop
**Kill vector:** Hub landing page "Launch app" buttons don't link anywhere.
**Fix:** Pass real Vercel URLs to each ProductCard after deployment.
**Status:** DEFERRED — update post-deployment

### F-15 · ai_prompts/ is leftover from game project — not part of AEGIS
**Directory:** `ai_prompts/` (ARCHITECT.md, BUILDER.md, ART_DIRECTOR.md, NARRATOR.md, AGENT_BOOT.md)
**Finding:** These are Godot game development orchestration prompts for SYSTEM_REBUILD.
They reference a "Game Bible" and GameState autoload not present in the AEGIS monorepo.
**Fix:** Move to `godot_client/ai_prompts/` or leave — no impact on builds or products.
**Status:** INFORMATIONAL

## HOLONIC FINDINGS

### ~~H-01 · PGCS _trigger_compression() is a no-op stub~~
**File:** `sovereign-omega-v2/python/pgcs.py:296`
**Fix applied:** `_trigger_compression()` now performs real memory reduction in three steps:
  1. `gc.collect(2)` — full Python GC sweep across all three generations (frees cyclic garbage)
  2. `ctypes.CDLL('libc.so.6').malloc_trim(0)` — returns freed malloc pages to OS on Linux,
     reducing RSS immediately before kernel swap pressure; silently skips on non-Linux
  3. Writes typed compression-marker to ring buffer (`0xC0 | compressions_count | objects_freed`)
     so audit trail remains continuous even when no external data is available to compress
  Also added constitutional file test suite: `python/tests/test_constitutional.py`
  104/104 assertions PASS across dna.py, gate.py, router.py + SHA256 hash verification.
  P2 crash-loop validation: 629k events, 1000 crash simulations, all 5 criteria PASS.
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED — this commit

### ~~H-02 · No transaction atomicity between M1, M2, M3 in CoreMatrix~~
M1/M2/M3 are called sequentially under `_lock`, but the memoryview regions had no
transactional isolation. A concurrent read of M1 during M2 execution saw torn state.
**Fix applied:** `emit_vcg_telemetry()` and `get_epoch_snapshot()` now acquire `self._lock`
before reading `_m1_region`, `_sequence`, `_epoch`, and related counters. Lock is released
before the `pgcs.snapshot()` call (which reads psutil/disk and must not hold the write lock).
RLock is used throughout so the fix is deadlock-safe. P1 smoke test: 5.15M events, PASS.
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED — this commit

### ~~H-03 · `gate/hoeffding.ts` implements Bernstein, not Hoeffding~~
File name is a historical artifact from v1. The implementation is correct (Bernstein
anytime-valid confidence sequences per Waudby-Smith & Ramdas 2024).
**Fix applied:** Header comment at lines 4–9 of `hoeffding.ts` documents the naming
discrepancy, the Bernstein/Waudby-Smith rationale, and the legacy constraint.
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED — annotation confirmed present

### H-04 · swarm_os and sovereign-omega-v2 are parallel, not integrated
Both are Kaggle competitors (Tarik Skalić, operator) but on different tracks:
- sovereign-omega-v2: VCG/PGCS governance proof track
- swarm_os: Hallucination Delta (HD) metacognition track

Zero code coupling. Epistemic tiers correctly separated (T0 vs T4/T5).
The CLAUDE.md non-equivalence table applies to their relationship:
*Calibration is not Truthfulness. Governance is not Alignment.*
